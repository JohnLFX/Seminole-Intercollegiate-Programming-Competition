/**
 * <h3>Line Up</h3>
 * <p>A group of boys and girls line up by height in separate classrooms â€“
 * boys in one room and girls in a different room. Eventually they must be
 * merged into one line arranged by height with the shortest student first.
 * You need to write an application that merges a list containing the heights
 * of the girls with a list containing the heights of the boys.</p>
