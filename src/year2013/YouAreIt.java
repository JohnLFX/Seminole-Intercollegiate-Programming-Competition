/**
 * <h3>You Are It</h3>
 * <p>Kids at a birthday party want to play a favorite game modeled after the game of tag.
 * Unfortunately it is raining so they canâ€™t go outside.
 * They can't run in the house so you decide to write a computer application to simulate the game.
 * In the game the children sit in a circle and one person outside the ring (the leader)
 * sings a song with a fixed number of words. Moving clockwise around the circle,
 * the leader points to a new child in the ring for each word in the song.
 * The child being pointed to on the last word of the song is out and must leave the circle.
 * The leader then repeats the process with the smaller circle.
 * The game continues until the last child is eliminated.
 * This child is then the leader to start the next game.</p>
